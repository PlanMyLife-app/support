# Goals And Projects

### Introduction

Weekly tasks related to your long term goals. To pick the task for current week you first need to setup your goals in the [My Goals](../my-goals.md) section.

These tasks are directly assigned from your goals and contribute to the fulfilling of you yearly life goals.
