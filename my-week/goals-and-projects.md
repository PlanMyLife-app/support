# Goals And Projects

### Introduction

Weekly tasks related to your long-term goals. To pick the task for the current week you first need to set up your goals in the [My Goals](../my-goals.md) section.

These tasks are directly assigned from your goals and contribute to the fulfillment of your yearly life goals.

#### Add Goal/Task

There are two ways how to pick the task from your goals:

1. Click on the '**Add goal/task**' field. This will open the modal with a list of all your goals and their subtasks. You can pick one or multiple tasks that will be assigned to the currently selected week.
