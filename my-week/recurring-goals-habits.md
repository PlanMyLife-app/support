# Recurring Goals/Habits

### Introduction

Weekly recurring tasks related to your long-term goals. To pick the task for the current week you first need to set up your goals in the [My Goals](../my-goals.md) section.

These tasks are directly assigned from your goals and contribute to the fulfillment of your yearly life goals.

#### Create recurring goal/habit

Once you have your goal ready you can click on the goal's **action menu** \(three dots\) and choose the '**Conver to habit**' option.
