## My goals

> The victory of success is half won when one gains the habit of setting and achieving goals.

* Og Mandino

### Introduction

For half of my life, I just wandered around without any reasonable goals. I mean, I had plans. I kept them in my mind, changed the direction regularly, and never stick to most of them. It never felt right. More like constant unhappiness with the direction my life is going.

Setting goals provide direction, guides your focus, and helps you sustain momentum in life. It also helps to maintain motivation when you are down. And achieving the goals give a sense of personal satisfaction and accomplishment.

Writing your goals down frees your mind to focus on other essential things in your life and helps to fight procrastination.
